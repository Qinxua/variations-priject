        <h1>   With its cloud of skirmishers in advance,</h1>
        
        <h2> With now the sound of a single shot snapping like a whip, and now an
            irregular volley,</h2>

      
        <p>       <br> The swarming ranks press on and on, the dense brigades press on,
         Glittering dimly, toiling under the sun—the dust-cover'd men,
         In columns rise and fall to the undulations of the ground,
         With artillery interspers'd—the wheels rumble, the horses sweat,</div></p>
             <p>  As the &nbsp;army corps advances.</p>
