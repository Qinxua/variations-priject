        <title>AN ARMY <br>CORPS ON THE MARCH.</title>

        <h1>With <br>its cloud of skirmishers in advance,</h1>
        
        <h2> With now <br>the sound of a single shot snapping like a whip, and now an
            irregular volley,</h2>

       <p>  The swarming <br>ranks press on and on, the &nbsp;dense brigades press on,
        Glittering dimly, toiling under the sun—the dust-cover'd men,
        In columns rise and fall &nbsp;&nbsp;to the undulations of &nbsp;the ground,
        With artillery interspers'd—the wheels rumble, the horses sweat,</p>
        As the &nbsp;army corps advances.
