        <h1> With its cloud <br>of skirmishers &nbsp;in advance,</h1>
        
        <h2> With now the sound of a single <br>shot snapping like a whip, and now an
            irregular volley,</h2>

            <br> The swarming ranks press on and on, &nbsp;the dense brigades press on,
            Glittering dimly, toiling <br> the sun—the dust-cover'd men,
            In columns rise and <br><br>fall to the undulations of the ground,
            With artillery interspers'd—the wheels rumble, the &nbsp;horses sweat,
            <p>  <br>As the army corps advances.</p>
