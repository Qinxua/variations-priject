        <h1>  With its cloud of skirmishers in advance,</h1>
        
        <h2>  With </h2>
        <h3>now the sound of a single shot snapping like a whip, and now an
            irregular volley,</h3>

       <p>       <br> The swarming ranks press on and on, the dense brigades press on,
        Glittering dimly, toiling under the sun—the dust-cover'd men,
        In columns rise and fall to the undulations of the ground,<div>
        With artillery interspers'd—the wheels rumble, the horses sweat,</div></p>
            <p><strong>    As the &nbsp;army corps advances.</strong></p>
